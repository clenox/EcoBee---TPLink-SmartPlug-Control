# EcoBee---TPLink-SmartPlug-Control
Control TPLink smart plugs with EcoBee sensor data

heatrun.py is used to control multiple electric space heaters on TPLink smartplugs based on temperature data from EcoBee remote sensors.

Also included is a separate utility, token_mngr.py to maintain up to date ecobee access and refresh tokens.  This must be run simulataneously with the main program.  It is generally useful for any developer working with ecobee.
